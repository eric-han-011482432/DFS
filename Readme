Description:
This is homework assignment for CS249 Distributed Computing course at SJSU, Fall 2017. 
This is a java implementation of DFS spanning tree with specified root in the graph. There is a Buffer class that extends Java Observable, a Processor that implements Java Observer, and a Message enum class that contains the values {M, PARENT, ALREADY}.

Overview:
Main.java
	In this module, a graph is populated with processors and neighbors using map.  It accepts user input to generate a graph. It also contains a main() method, which wakes the root up by sending <M> to its buffer. Two functions, to print the input graph and output spanning tree, have been implemented within this class

Processor.java
	This module implements Observer interface and thus provides implementation for update() method of observer. Update method decides processor's behavior after being notified by a change in observable buffer. Every processor calls an explore() method to discover children and to send <M> to all its neighbors. 

Message.java
	It contains Message enum with values PARENT, ALREADY and M.

Buffer.java
	Buffer is an observable of a processor and it notifies its processor instance of any change in its state.

Input:
A graph in the form of adjacency list.
Map <Processor, List<Processor> >
where, 
	key = Processor
	value = list of neighbor processors
E.g.
---------Input Graph-------
P0 --> [P1 P2 P3 ]
P1 --> [P0 P2 P4 ]
P2 --> [P0 P1 P5 ]
P3 --> [P0 ]
P4 --> [P1 P5 ]
P5 --> [P2 P4 ]



Output:
User will be prompted to enter id for a processor, which will act as a root of spanning tree.

Example 1 :
Enter a specific root node to start from (Values from 0-5):	
5

Input Graph:

P0: [P1 P2 P3 ]
P1: [P0 P2 P4 ]
P2: [P0 P1 P5 ]
P3: [P0 ]
P4: [P1 P5 ]
P5: [P5 P2 P4 ]


	<M> received at P5
	<M> received at P2
	<M> received at P0
	<M> received at P1
	<M> received at P2
	<ALREADY> received at P1
	<M> received at P4
	<M> received at P5
	<ALREADY> received at P4
	<PARENT> received at P1
	<PARENT> received at P0
	<M> received at P3
	<PARENT> received at P0
	<PARENT> received at P2
	<M> received at P1
	<ALREADY> received at P2
	<PARENT> received at P5
	<M> received at P4
	<ALREADY> received at P5

Final Spanning Tree:

P0: [P1 P3 ]
P1: [P4 ]
P2: [P0 ]
P3: []
P4: []
P5: [P2 ]
